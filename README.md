# mst_searching
The algorithm searches a minimum spanning tree and a minimum spanning forest (also known as an optimum branching or a minimum-cost arborescence) in directed graphs by means of Chu-Liu/Edmonds algorithm.

By means of this program you can do the following:
1. Searching the minimum spanning tree in the directed graph
2. Searching the minimum forest in the one
3. Separately it handles the case of the potential graph
